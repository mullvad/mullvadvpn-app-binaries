# Custom third party binaries for the Mullvad VPN app

This repository holds our custom binaries and build scripts for third party software we need to
bundle with the Mullvad VPN app: OpenVPN for our target platforms, `libmnl` and
`libnftnl` for Linux, and Wintun and WireGuardNT for Windows.


## Security and integrity

This repository should conform to the same integrity standards as the main
[Mullvad VPN app] repository, meaning that every merge commit has to be signed.

This repository contains a number of submodules, pulling in the source code for the third party
software we store the binaries for. These submodules must point to commits that are either
directly signed or has a signed tag attached to them. Upon moving a submodule to a different
commit, the new commit must be cryptographically verified.


## OpenVPN

The `openvpn` submodule is tracking our [`mullvad-patches`] branch that contain a few custom
changes needed by the [Mullvad VPN app].

### Updating OpenVPN

When bumping the submodule (rebasing `mullvad-patches`) to a new OpenVPN release. Make sure
the upstream release tag is properly signed by the following gpg key:

```
B62E6A2B4E56570B7BDC6BE01D829EFECA562812
```

Then tag the new head of `mullvad-patches` as `<original tag name>-mullvad`, for example
`v2.4.8-mullvad`. This tag should be signed and pushed to our fork repository.

Repeat the process above for the `openvpn-build`. Note: The upstream tags are not signed in
`openvpn-build`.

### Building on Linux + macOS

Before building, one has to ensure that the build host has all the required
dependencies installed, as outlined in [OpenVPN's buildslave documentation].

Building the OpenVPN binary should be as simple as running `make openvpn`.

#### Linux

Currently, the Linux distro of choice for building OpenVPN currently is Debian
9, issues have been experienced on other distributions.

#### Building for ARM macOS

Building for Apple Silicon macOS is done by cross-compiling from Intel macOS by adding the `TARGET="aarch64-apple-darwin"` option, i.e.:
```bash
make openvpn TARGET="aarch64-apple-darwin"
```

#### Building for ARM64 Linux

Follow the normal instructions, or cross-compile on x64 Linux by setting the appropriate `TARGET`:

```bash
# Install gcc for arm64
#apt install gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu
make openvpn TARGET="aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu"
```

### Building for Windows

Building `openvpn.exe` for Windows is done by cross-compiling from Linux using
a mingw-w64 toolchain. You need to do this build on a recent Debian or Ubuntu
release, one should generally follow the instructions laid out in the
[OpenVPN's build system docs]. Currently, this has only been tested with Debian 9.


1. Install the dependencies and cross-compile toolchain:
   ```bash
   ./setup-generic-buildsystem.6.sh
   ```

1. Compile:
   ```bash
   make openvpn_windows
   ```

1. Sign `openvpn.exe` - Do this by copying `openvpn.exe` to the Windows machine with
   the certificate and run:
   ```bash
   signtool sign /tr http://timestamp.digicert.com /td sha256 /fd sha256 \
       /d "Mullvad VPN" \
       /du "https://github.com/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app#readme" \
       /f the_certificate.pfx \
       /p <the_certificate.pfx password> \
       openvpn.exe
   ```



## OpenSSL
OpenSSL is a transitive dependency for OpenVPN.
When bumping the submodule to a new OpenSSL release. Make sure to only point to a release tag,
and not a random commit. Also verify that said tag is properly signed by the following gpg key:

```
8657ABB260F056B1E5190839D9C4D26D0E604491
```

or

```
7953AC1FBC3DC8B3B292393ED5E9E43F7DF9EE8C
```

## `libmnl` and `libnftnl`

These libraries are only required for Linux and are required by our app to
apply firewall rules. To produce the required libraries, run `make libnftnl`.

#### Cross-compiling for ARM64 Linux

You can cross-compile both libraries on x64 Linux by setting the appropriate `TARGET`:

```bash
# Install gcc for arm64
#apt install gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu
make libnftnl TARGET="aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu"
```

## Updating Wintun

Only applicable to Windows.

Wintun is found in `.\x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\wintun\wintun.dll`. The driver can be downloaded and verified
by running the script `.\wireguard\download-wintun.bat`. This script downloads Wintun, verifies its
checksum, and makes sure that wintun.dll is correctly signed.


## WireGuardNT

Only applicable to Windows.

WireGuardNT can be found in `.\x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\wireguard-nt`. The `wireguard-nt`
submodule contains a [fork](https://github.com/mullvad/wireguard-nt) that fixes multihop tunnels.
To update it, pull the new tag from https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-nt, manually verify that the
changes are sensible, and rebase the `mullvad-patches-build` branch on top of it. The new head of
`mullvad-patches-build` should be tagged as `<original tag name>-mullvad`, for example
`0.7-mullvad`. This tag should be signed and pushed to the fork repository.

Follow the instructions in `MULLVAD_BUILD.md` in said submodule to build and sign the driver.


## Split tunnel driver

Only applicable to Windows.

The split tunneling functionality implemented in [Mullvad VPN app] is supported by a custom kernel driver.
The driver is developed by us, and is represented here as a submodule named `win-split-tunnel`.

Instructions for building and signing the driver are provided in said submodule.

The built and signed driver, and associated files, reside under `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\split-tunnel`.


## Storage of binaries

This repository, apart from having the scripts used to build OpenVPN, also holds the built binaries
for the platforms we need. These exist under directories named after the target triplet they are
intended for.
